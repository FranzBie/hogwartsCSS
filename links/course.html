						<div class="overlay">Astronomy is the only 
						field of study at Hogwarts that has a direct equivalent in the Muggle world.
						Astronomy classes take place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in 
						Hogwarts, and are taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve observations 
						of the night skies with telescopes.</div>
						<img class="coursI" src="../img/sub1.jpg">
						</td>
					
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Charms is the type of spells concerned with giving an
						object new and unexpected properties, and hence this class mainly consists
						on learning those sorts of spells. Charms classes are described as notoriously
						noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are largely practical. Many of the exposition 
						sequences in the books are set in Charms classes, which are on the second floor of Hogwarts.</div>
						<img class="coursI" src="../img/sub2.jpg">
						</td>
					
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A.,
						is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts 
						and to be protected from Dark creatures.</div>

						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Flying is the class that teaches the use of broomsticks 
						made for the use of flying and is taught only to Hogwarts first year by 
						Rolanda Hooch. The subject is the only one that requires physicality.</div>
						<img class="coursI" src="../img/sub4.jpg">
						</td>
					
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Herbology is the study of magical plants and how to take
						care of, utilise and combat them. There are at least three greenhouses, holding
						a variety of magical plants of varying degrees of lethality. Herbology is also 
						the subject Neville Longbottom excels in. He later replaces Professor Sprout as 
						the Herbology teacher.</div>
						<img class="coursI" src="../img/sub5.jpg">
						</td>
					
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">History of Magic is the study of magical history. Cuthbert 
						Binns' lessons are depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They are only
						lectures, given without pause, about significant events in wizarding history. 
						Topics have included Goblin Rebellions, Giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy. </div>

						<th>Potions</th>

						<th>Arithmancy</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Potions is described as the art of creating mixtures with
						magical effects. It requires the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at 
						the right times and temperatures. Snape's lessons are depicted as unhappy, 
						oppressing times set in a gloomy dungeon in the basement of the castle, whilst 
						Horace Slughorn's, who replaces Severus Snape as Potions Master, is shown as more 
						cheerful and even fun at times.</div>
						<img class="coursI" src="../img/sub7.jpg">
						</td>
					
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Transfiguration is the art of changing the form or appearance
						of an object, and hence this is what this class teaches. Transfiguration is a theory-based
						subject, including topics such as "Switching Spells"; Vanishing Spells;
						and Conjuring Spells. It is possible to change inanimate objects 
						into animate ones and vice versa, Minerva McGonagall, the class's teacher, transfigures her desk 
						into a pig.</div>
						<img class="coursI" src="../img/sub8.jpg">
						</td>
					
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Arithmancy is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties
						of numbers. It is a favourite subject of Hermione Granger. Arithmancy is reportedly difficult, 
						as it requires memorising or working with many charts. It is also an elective course, that can 
						be taken by students third year and above. The subject is taught by Professor Septima Vector. 
						It is separated into normal Arithmancy and Advanced Arithmancy Studies</div>

						<th>Care of Magical Creatures</th>					
						<th>Divination</th>
						<th>Apparition</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Care of Magical Creatures is the class which instructs 
						students on how to care for magical beasts. Classes are held outside the castle.
						In Harry's first two years, the class is taken by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn who
						then retires "in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs".</div>
						<img class="coursI" src="../img/sub10.jpg">
						</td>
					
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Divination is the art of predicting the future. Various methods
						are described, including tea leaves, Fire-omens, Crystal balls, Palmistry, Cartomancy 
						(including the reading of conventional playing cards and the tarot), astrology, and Dream 
						interpretations. </div>
						<img class="coursI" src="../img/sub11.jpg">
						</td>
					
						<td>
						<div class="overlay">Apparition is the magical form of teleportation in the wizarding world.
						Lessons are optional to those in the sixth and seventh years. In the wizarding world, performing 
						Apparition requires a licence and may only be legally performed by people over seventeen years of age. 
						The described reason for the restriction is that Apparition is dangerous if done improperly: 
						insufficient concentration may lead to body parts being left behind in an unfortunate side-effect 
						known as splinching </div>
