					highest towers at Hogwarts, the entrance was situated on the seventh
					floor in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a portrait of
					The Fat Lady. She permits entrance if given the correct password,

					in the 1990s was Filius Flitwick. The ghost of Ravenclaw is the Grey Lady, who was the 
					daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the house's founder. Ravenclaw corresponds to the element 
					of air. The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories are located in a tower on the west side
					of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to 
					enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, can be answered by non-Ravenclaws. Famous Ravenclaws
					include Gilderoy Lockheart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander. It is 
					rumoured that Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody was a Ravenclaw.</p>
